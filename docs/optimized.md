# Be Optimized

A node is optimized when it maximizes performance and minimizes resource usage.

In AnarchyGraph, optimization goals:

- Efficient algorithms to handle node interactions and data processing.
- Minimizing memory footprint to allow for scalable implementations.
- Reducing computational overhead to ensure swift operations.

The goal is to ensure each node operates at its best, enabling the entire graph to function seamlessly and efficiently under various load conditions and implementations.
