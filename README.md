# AnarchyGraph

AnarchyGraph is a lightweight, decentralized, node-centric graph system in Python.

## Rules of AnarchyGraph

1. Be **independent**
2. Be **simple**

### Be Independent

A node is independent when it can operate and interact autonomously of other nodes.

In AnarchyGraph, each node is self-contained, having all it needs to interact with other nodes.

This independence promotes the self-organizing and self-sustaining nature of the graph without centralized control.

### Be Simple

A node is simple when it performs its purpose efficiently and effectively.

This means the code and design should be optimized for speed and simplicity, making it easy to understand and manage any operational complexity within the graph.

While the node itself should remain straightforward, the data it handles can be complex.
